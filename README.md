## About

‚ö†Ô∏è üß™ Note: this project is _for demonstration use only_ as a companion app to the December 2020 talk, [Automating CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Google Cloud](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/Automating-CI-CD-Actions-Google-Cloud/). 

In this talk, we show how to use [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions) to authenticate with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and then build, publish, and deploy a containerized app to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). Messages and browser session are saved in [Cloud Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore). 

The app architecture is explained at a high-level [here](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development

If you would like to run your own instance of Octochat, see setup instructions [here](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! See how to [contribute](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
